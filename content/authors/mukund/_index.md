I'm a data scientist at Asimov, where I work on developing computational models of cell biophysics,  analyzing diverse biological datasets, and developing machine learning algorithms to guide the intelligent design of genetic circuits. 

Prior to this, I was a computational scientist with the Xavier Lab at the Broad Institute, and in a past life, I was briefly a graduate student with the MIT Heavy Ion group. 

Outside of work, I enjoy skiing, rock climbing, science fiction/fantasy and board games.
